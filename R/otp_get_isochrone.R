#' Returns one or more travel time isochrones (OTPv1 only)
#'
#' Returns one or more travel time isochrones in either GeoJSON format or as an
#' \strong{sf} object. Only works correctly for walk and/or transit modes - a limitation
#' of OTP. Isochrones can be generated either \emph{from} a location or \emph{to}
#' a location.
#' @param otpcon An OTP connection object produced by \code{\link{otp_connect}}.
#' @param format Character, required format of returned isochrone(s). Either JSON
#' (returns GeoJSON) or SF (returns simple feature collection). Default is JSON.
#' @param cutoffs Numeric vector, containing the cutoff times in seconds. for
#' example: 'c(900, 1800, 2700)' would request 15, 30 and 60 minute isochrones.
#' Can be a single value.
#' @param location Numeric vector, Latitude/Longitude pair, e.g. `c(53.48805, -2.24258)`
#' @param fromLocation Logical. If TRUE (default) the isochrone
#' will be generated \emph{from} the \code{location}. If FALSE the isochrone will
#' be generated \emph{to} the \code{location}.
#' @param mode Character vector, mode(s) of travel. Valid values are: WALK,
#' TRANSIT, BUS, RAIL, TRAM, SUBWAY. TRANSIT will use all available transit modes.
#' Default is TRANSIT. WALK mode is automatically added to
#' TRANSIT, BUS, RAIL, TRAM, and SUBWAY. Due to an OTP limitation this
#' function is \emph{not} suitable for CAR or BICYCLE modes.
#' @param date Character, must be in the format mm-dd-yyyy. This is the desired date of travel.
#' Only relevant for transit modes. Default is the current system date.
#' @param time Character, must be in the format hh:mm:ss.
#' If \code{arriveBy} is FALSE (the default) this is the desired departure time, otherwise the
#' desired arrival time. Only relevant for transit modes. Default is the current system time.
#' @param arriveBy Logical. Whether a trip should depart (FALSE) or arrive (TRUE) at the specified
#' date and time. Default is FALSE.
#' @param maxWalkDistance Numeric. The maximum distance (in meters) that the user is
#' willing to walk. Default is NULL (the parameter is not passed to the API and the OTP
#' default of unlimited takes effect).
#' This is a soft limit in OTPv1 and is ignored if the mode is WALK only. In OTPv2
#' this parameter imposes a hard limit on WALK, CAR and BICYCLE modes (see:
#' \url{http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/OTP2-MigrationGuide/#router-config}).
#' @param walkReluctance A single numeric value. A multiplier for how bad walking is
#' compared to being in transit for equal lengths of time. Default = 2.
#' @param waitReluctance A single numeric value. A multiplier for how bad waiting for a
#' transit vehicle is compared to being on a transit vehicle. This should be greater
#' than 1 and less than \code{walkReluctance} (see API docs). Default = 1.
#' @param transferPenalty Integer. An additional penalty added to boardings after
#' the first. The value is in OTP's internal weight units, which are roughly equivalent to seconds.
#' Set this to a high value to discourage transfers. Default is 0.
#' @param minTransferTime Integer. The minimum time, in seconds, between successive
#' trips on different vehicles. This is designed to allow for imperfect schedule
#' adherence. This is a minimum; transfers over longer distances might use a longer time.
#' Default is 0.
#' @param batch Logical. If true, goal direction is turned off and a full path tree is built
#' @param extra.params A list of any other parameters accepted by the OTP API LIsochrone entry point. For
#' advanced users. Be aware that otpr will carry out no validation of these additional
#' parameters. They will be passed directly to the API. Do not pass 'fromPlace' or 'toPlace'
#' to this function. These parameters are handled internally based on the values of \code{location}
#' and \code{fromLocation}.
#' @return Returns a list. First element in the list is \code{errorId}. This is "OK" if
#' OTP successfully returned the isochrone(s), otherwise it is "ERROR". The second
#' element of list varies:
#' \itemize{
#' \item If \code{errorId} is "ERROR" then \code{response} contains the OTP error message.
#' \item If \code{errorId} is "OK" then \code{response} contains the the isochrone(s) in
#' either GeoJSON format or as an \strong{sf} object, depending on the value of the
#' \code{format} argument.
#' }
#' The third element of the list is \code{query} which is a character string containing the URL
#' that was submitted to the OTP API.
